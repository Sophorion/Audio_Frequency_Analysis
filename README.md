# Audio_Frequency_Analysis
This repository demonstrates the generation and analysis of audio signals using Python. It includes scripts to generate sinusoidal tones, combine signals, and perform Fourier Transform to visualize frequency components and resample audio. Key tools used are NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for signal processing and spectral analysis.
